# Ruby program to illustrate the Numbers Data Type

# float type
distance = 0.1

# both integer and float type
time = 9.87 / 3600
speed = distance / time
puts "The average speed of a sprinter is #{speed} km/h"

# Ruby program to illustrate the Boolean Data Type

  puts "It is True!"
else
  puts "It is False!"
end

if nil
  puts "nil is True!"
else
  puts "nil is False!"
end
